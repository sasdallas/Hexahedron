# Hexahedron
Hexahedron is a modern replacement for the reduceOS kernel.

## What is this?
A replacement for the reduceOS kernel, developed to follow standards better and have higher code quality.c

## What's 'polyhedron'?
Polyhedron (or libpolyhedron) is the libk designed to go with Hexahedron and its libc. The naming conventions are dumb, sorry.

Polyhedron serves as both a built-in C library and the kernel C library. The two are distinguished in the codebase.
