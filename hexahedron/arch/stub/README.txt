== What is the stub architecture?

When porting Hexahedron, you want to make sure the build system is fully ready to support your architecture.
This is where the stub architecture comes into play. It provides dummy versions of the functions required to support Hexahedron. 
These versions do nothing, but can be copied and added later on!

== Can I compile the stub architecture?

I wouldn't recommend it.
