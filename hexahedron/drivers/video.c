/**
 * @file hexahedron/drivers/video.c
 * @brief Generic video driver
 * 
 * This video driver system handles abstracting the video layer away.
 * It supports text-only video drivers (but may cause gfx display issues) and it
 * supports pixel-based video drivers.
 * 
 * The video system works by drawing in a linear framebuffer and then passing it to the video driver
 * to update the screen based off this linear framebuffer.
 * 
 * Video acceleration (for font drawers) is allowed, they are allowed to manually modify the pixels of the system
 * without bothering to mess with anything else.
 * 
 * Currently, implementation is rough because we are at the beginnings of a new kernel,
 * but here is what is planned:
 * - Implement a list system to allow choosing
 * - Allow arguments to modify this
