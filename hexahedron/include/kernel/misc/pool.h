 * @brief Header for the memory pool system
 * 
 * @warning This system is very finnicky. It is best to use a static-allocated pool
 *          with a memory space that YOU control. If not possible, the kernel heap should work,
 *          but it very well may make the system entirely unstable. Who knows.
 * 
 * @warning You may not destroy a pool. Any pools created are final.
